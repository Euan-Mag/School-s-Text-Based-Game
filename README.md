I worked on this game project during my computer science teacher's 2-week absence. Inspired by the 1989 Capcom game, Sweet Home, I wanted to make a game where the player would be stuck in a mansion and have to find a key to leave it while fighting zombies along the way, eventually finding an ally (named 'Chester Bennginton').

I would've focused on creating more allies and enemies, but due to me not knowing when is the return of my teacher, I decided to create only one ally and one enemy.

I focused mainly on planning (seen in the decomposition chart), but towards the end I completely concentrated on coding the game.

My teacher set this task to show the difference OOP (Object Oriented Programming) can make, but due to my prior experience with it via learning C#, I was able to write cleaner and more organised code that what would've been possible without the aforementioned experience.
