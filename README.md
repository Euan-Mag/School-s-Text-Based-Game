Written in Python.

I worked on this game project during my computer science teacher's 2-week absence. Inspired by the 1989 Capcom game, Sweet Home, I wanted to make a game where the player would be stuck in a mansion and have to find a key to escape it while fighting zombies along the way.

I initially planned to create various allies and enemies, but because I was uncertain about when my teacher would return, I decided to include just one ally (named 'Chester Bennington') and one enemy.

I focused mainly on planning (seen in the decomposition chart), but towards the end, I completely concentrated on coding the game.

My teacher set this task to show the difference OOP can make, but due to my prior experience with it via learning C#, I was able to write cleaner and more organised code than what would've been possible without the prior experience.
