Dust-laden beams of light filter through shattered, stained-glass windows, casting fractured colors across the cracked marble floor. A grand, sweeping staircase dominates the room, its once-polished banister now dulled and splintered. Cobwebs drape the ornate chandeliers, which hang precariously from the vaulted ceiling. The faint scent of mildew mingles with the stale air, and faded tapestries hang limply on the walls, their stories lost to time. Amid the decay, hints of former grandeur lingerâ€”an intricately carved fireplace, tarnished gold accents, and the ghostly echoes of forgotten footsteps."

The wallpaper peels in long, curling strips, revealing discolored plaster underneath. A tarnished mirror on the dresser reflects the faint glimmer of a shattered chandelier, its broken crystals scattered across the floor. Cobwebs lace the corners, and the air is heavy with the musty scent of decay, whispering stories of a bygone grandeur..."
